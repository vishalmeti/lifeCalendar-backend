- **API Documentation**: Interactive Swagger documentation

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js & Express**: For the server and API framework
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: For the database and object modeling
- **JWT**: For secure authentication
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**: For generating intelligent summaries
- **Swagger**: For API documentation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- MongoDB database
- Google Generative AI API key

## API Endpoints

All data-modifying and data-retrieval endpoints (except for register/login) are protected and require a Bearer Token in the `Authorization` header.

* **Authentication (`/api/auth`)**
    * `POST /register`: Register a new user.
    * `POST /login`: Log in an existing user and receive a JWT.
    * `GET /user`: Get details of the currently authenticated user (protected).

* **Daily Entries (`/api/entries`)**
    * `POST /`: Create a new daily entry (AI summary is generated and stored in the `Summary` collection).
    * `GET /`: Get all daily entries for the logged-in user (with populated summaries).
    * `GET /:id`: Get a specific daily entry by ID (with populated summary).
    * `PUT /:id`: Update a daily entry by ID (AI summary is re-generated/updated).
    * `DELETE /:id`: Delete a daily entry by ID (associated summary is also deleted).
    * `POST /:id/generate-summary`: On-demand (re-)generation of the AI summary for a specific entry.

* **Stories (`/api/stories`)**
    * `POST /generate`: Generate a new AI story based on daily entries/summaries within a specified date range.
    * `GET /`: Get all generated stories for the logged-in user.
    * `GET /:id`: Get a specific story by ID.
    * `DELETE /:id`: Delete a story by ID.

* **Chatbot (`/api/chatbot`)**
    * `POST /query`: Submit a natural language query (e.g., "When did I start Project X?") to the chatbot. The backend searches relevant summaries and uses Gemini AI to formulate a response.

## ðŸ¤– AI Integration

This backend heavily utilizes Google's Gemini AI for:
* **Daily Summarization:** Condensing daily activities (meetings, tasks, mood, journal notes) into concise summaries.
* **Story Generation:** Weaving narratives from a series of daily entries/summaries to create a "storybook" or timeline reflection.
* **Chatbot Assistance:** Understanding user queries about their past activities and generating helpful responses based on their stored data.
